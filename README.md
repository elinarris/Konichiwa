      Proper manners are valued highly in Japan, and foreign visitors should be familiar with at least the most basic rules.
      A few habits include; <a href="#yeah">etiquette while eating</a>, <a href="#whatever">mannerisms at someone's home</a>, and <a href="#ok">proper greetings</a>.
     The code of etiquette in Japan governs the expectations of social behavior in the country and is considered very important.
     Like many social cultures, etiquette varies greatly depending on one's status relative to the person in question. 
     Many books instruct readers on its minutiae. 
     Some conventions may be very regional practices, and thus may not exist in all regions of Japan. Some customs have changed over the course of Japanese history.
     The following are generally accepted modern customs in Japan.

    Japanese bowing is essential when greeting in Japan.
  It's commonly used as a sign of salutation, reverence, apology or gratitude in social or religious situations.
  While there are few official records on how the etiquette of bowing originated in Japan, it is widely believed 
  that it traces its roots back to the propagation of Buddhism to Japan from the kingdoms of ancient China between 
  the 5th and 8th centuries. In Buddhist teachings, bowing is an important gesture of piety and respect. 
  Worshipers bow to Buddha statues in devotion, and disciples bow to their masters in admiration. 
  Such religious etiquette was often believed to be the foundation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojigi">ojigi</a> in Japan.

    <p>Meals in Japan traditionally begin with the word itadakimasu (いただきます, literally, "I humbly receive"). 
      Similar to <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/bon-appetit">"bon appétit"</a> or saying grace, it expresses gratitude for all who played a role in providing the food. 
      Not finishing one's meal is not considered impolite in Japan, but rather is taken as a signal to the host that one wishes 
      to be served another helping. Conversely, finishing one's meal completely, especially the rice, indicates that one is 
      satisfied and therefore does not wish to be served any more. Children are especially encouraged to eat every last grain 
      of rice. It is impolite to pick out certain ingredients and leave the rest. One should chew with the mouth closed. Many 
      Japanese restaurants provide diners with single-use wooden/bamboo chopsticks that must be snapped apart near their tops 
      (which are thicker than the bottoms). As a result, the attachment area may produce small splinters.
      Rubbing chopsticks together to remove splinters is considered impolite, implying that one thinks the utensils are cheap.

    <p>A lot of rules regarding indoor manners in Japan are related to footwear. A clear line is traditionally 
      drawn between inside and outside, and outdoor shoes and indoor slippers are handled accordingly. 
      For foot wear purposes, the border between inside and outside is not the door itself, but the entrance area 
      called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genkan">genkan</a>. The genkan is typically divided into a lower area where people take off and put their shoes and 
      the elevated area that is usually covered by a different type of flooring and marks the beginning of the indoor 
      living space. Don't step with your outdoor footware onto the elevated area. Likewise, when removing your shoes, 
      try to avoid stepping onto the genkan's lower area in your socks. Lastly, it is considered good manner to turn 
      your shoes to point towards the door after removing them. When visiting a lot of historic buildings, it may be 
      prudent for tourists to wear shoes that can be easily removed as you may be forced to put them off and on multiple 
      times per day. Furthermore, make sure your socks are neat and free of any holes. During rainy weather, wet umbrellas
      and raincoats are supposed to be left outside or at the entrance or put into plastic bags to prevent them from 
      dripping water indoors.
